excerpt: "No, you can't eat that tech. Someone chewed on it."

You've heard of the 5-second-rule, right: if something fell on the ground, it's okay to eat it within a window of 5 seconds. After that, it's tainted. It's not good anymore. It's not food. You can't eat it. Other ways of tainting food are bringing it into contact with soap, garbage, other people's saliva, watching an insect land on it and do something that can only be disgusting to it, or mixing it with inedible things.

Most of these rules sort of make sense. Humans have fairly reasonable instincts about what they can or can't eat. They also have similar instincts about technology <i>[unproven claim here]</i>. You notice it in conversations like this one <i>[the products mentioned don't actually exist]</i>:

## Hear, say

<i>Enter WARD, a person who has seen it all, and NOE, a person who enjoys suggesting things</i>

<p>NOE<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hey Ward, we need a solution for this thing we want to do. I suggest we use <em>Frodoonar</em>. It's open source.</p>
<p>WARD<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I've seen people having trouble configuring it properly at my old company. I don't think we should use it.</p>
<p>NOE<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, what didn't work?</p>
<p>WARD<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They ran into all sorts of problems all the time. I don't know the details, but it seems like that's not what we want.</p>
<p>NOE<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;What were they using it for?</p>
<p>WARD<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They wanted to use it as part of their infrastructure and it took them ages to set up and after that, some things still weren't working.</p>
<p>NOE<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hm, ya, I guess that's not so good then. How about we use <em>Gribbaloth</em>? I read a post on <em>HelpAGelp</em> recently where someone suggested using it as an alternative to <em>Frodoonar</em>.</p>
<p>WARD<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, I looked at the source code and it's written in <em>Derpty</em>. And you know who else uses <em>Derpty</em>...?</p>
<p>NOE<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Who?</p>
<p>WARD<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Have you not read that article recently where <em>Trocious</em> talked about their stack?</p>
<p>NOE<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;No, I didn't see that.</p>
<p>WARD<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ya, so they're using it. And, let me put it this way: I can't think of a single thing they produce that I like.</p>
<p>NOE<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hrm. So maybe that's not such a great idea then?</p>
<p>WARD<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Nope.</p>
<p>NOE<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I guess I'm gonna look around some more and see what people think is best...</p>

## Epilog

Yeah, so, the thing is: that's pretty much how many tech decisions are made.
